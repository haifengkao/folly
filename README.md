Folly: Facebook Open-source Library
-----------------------------------

### What is this?
The folly C++ library which works with C++14. It can be compiled successfully by Xcode 16.3.
The newer version of folly moves to C++17, which is too much headache for me. 


### Installation by Cocoapods
pod 'Flipper-Folly', :git => 'https://github.com/haifengkao/folly.git'
